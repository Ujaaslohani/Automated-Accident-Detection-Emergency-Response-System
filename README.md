# Automated Accident Detection Emergency Response System

This is an ongoing project at TATA Technologies made with AngularJS for frontend and Spring Boot for backend. The purpose of this product is to detect any accidents that maybe faced by a registered consumer and alert the disered emergency contacts about the same.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
